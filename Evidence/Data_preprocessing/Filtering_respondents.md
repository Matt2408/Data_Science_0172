## Respondents
From the start of the project we started with alot of respondents. At the first glance, we were really happy with the amount of data that we received. But the further we got into the project, the more inconsistencies we found.

To keep track of the issues and find out what's happening with every respondents, we started to talk with our project owner. Showing our findings (inconsistencies), the productowner then decided if we should use the corrospodent or drop them out. 

An example of this can be seen in the following picture:

G-force & time plot - Inconsistansies between correspondents
