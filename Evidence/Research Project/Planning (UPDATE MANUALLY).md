##Planning  Evidence

For the ActivePal project management we have been using the Agile (scrum) method. To follow the scrum method, there will be daily standups. Within our project the daily standup time is 9:30 and since day 1, we have been following this method every day. Within the daily standup we discuss the progress of the prior day and the plans for today. Also, we discuss issues that you might encountered. If you are stuck or not sure what you should be doing next, we make sure that clear that up and make new working pairs.  

At the end of the sprint, we hold a retrospective. This is the best way to look back at the last two weeks and make an evaluation of the progress that have been made. Also, we use this time to see how everybody is feeling and if we need to make changes to make sure that everybody is happy.  

Since we are using the Scrum method, this also means that every project member has a certain role. Every sprint we rotate the roles within our project group, to make sure that everybody is getting more experienced with Scrum and working together.  

The infrastructure/tool we have been using for this is Jira. Jira is a plan, track and manage software that is mostly used for software development. Within the ActivePal project Jira is not only used for software development but also for the research development from week 1.  

The main research questions have been divided into smaller tasks called research sub tasks. Every sub research question has a few tasks that help to answer the question and guide us to the right approach to give an answer. By combining Jira with our sub questions, we can plot all sub questions into the Jira Road Map. This gives the whole group a good overview about the questions that still need to be answered and the tasks needed to answer the sub questions.  

To get access to our Jira board you can contact one of the ActivePal group members for an invite and a brief explanation.
