##Task definition evidence
###Introduction 

Within this document you will find a global overview of our research plan. It contains the trouble domain of our project that explains what problem the CBS is currently having and why our problem owner wants to have this subject researched. The global research plan also explains our current main research questions that is divided into multiple sub questions. By answering all sub questions, you can answer the main research questions. 

Within the project we will be following the scrum methodology. You can find more about that in the ‘planning’ section of this document. If anything is not clear, or you want a better explanation please reach out to us.  

 

###Trouble domain 

The Central Bureau voor de statistiek (CBS) has the wish to measure the intensity of physical activities. Currently they are using health surveys which are not accurate enough for their purposes. Therefor the CBS have been looking into alternatives like the ActivePal accelerometer in combination with machine learning to give better and more accurate results when measuring the intensity of certain activities.  

Because of this the CBS started lab tests to collect sample data of various physical activities. It's our job to analyze, structure and build machine learning algorithms based on the collected data to see if we can determine if people adherence to (inter)national norm for physical activities and if we could measure the intensity of movement (without the heart rate information).
