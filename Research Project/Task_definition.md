## Task definition

### Introduction
As a group we decided that every group member will iterate over the research plan. We chosen this approach because everybody wanted to contribute to the research plan. 

I started with the first iteration, described what exactly I did. After my iteration my group members started to work on the same document. They added more detail, more topics and checked for spelling/grammer.

You can find the research plan [here](/Evidence/Research%20Project/Research%20plan%20by%20Matt%20V1.pdf). This document is the first iteration of the research plan (locally saved).
