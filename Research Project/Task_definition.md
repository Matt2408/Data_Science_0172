## Task definition

### Introduction
As a group we decided that every group member will iterate over the research plan. We chosen this approach because everybody wanted to contribute to the research plan. 

I started with the first iteration, described what exactly I did. After my iteration my group members started to work on the same document. They added more detail, more topics and checked for spelling/grammer.

You can find the research plan [here](/Evidence/Research%20Project/Research%20plan%20(1).docx). The subject task definition is within this document and is only written by me.

### My work
I myself started with the document to make sure that everybody knew what we needed to provide in the research plan. 

<b>First step: </b> Building a template for our research plan. Brainstorming what it should include, what topics I want to include and discussing with Tony Andrioli, what criteria there are.

<b>Second step: </b> Writing the introduction, trouble domain, research main questions, planning.

<b>Third step: </b> Review done by Dimitri and Mark & Mark. They changed some of the structure.

<b>Fourth step: </b> Review done by Tony Androili. He provided feedback on all the work I did so far.

<b>Fifth step: </b> I iterated over the comments/feedback of Tony Androili. 

<b>Last step: </b> Review of the research plan after everybody iterated about the project.
