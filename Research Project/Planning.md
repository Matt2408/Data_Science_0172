## Planning

### Introduction
At the start of the project we decided as a group how we would work on this project. In this first meeting we decided how we would plan meetings, do our daily standups and how we would communicate with our stakeholders. 


### My work

## Research plan / planning
For the research plan, I wrote a general description of our planning. You can read this in our research plan (chapter 3) on the following link [here](/Evidence/Research%20Project/Research%20plan%20by%20Matt%20V1.pdf).

## Jira planning
As a group everybody was responsible to keep track of the Jira board. I saw this task as really important because it's important that everybody has knowledge what you are doing, and what the current status is. As a group we decided that Ali would be the Jira master but I tried as much as I can to assist him, 
by 
* Assingning my own tasks
* Keeping track of the progress
* Keep the sprint backlog clean
* Keep the Jira board clean

#### Sprint burndown graphic
Since the beginning of the project we decided to use Jira as a tool to help us manage the project. Below you can see all the sprints that have been finished in the past. As you can see I was always active in managing the project and making sure that my assinged tasks were up to date. As a group we started to use Jira more and more later on in the project. 

The sprint log doesn't show a good example what exactly has been done by the invidiual persons, however it does show that I contributed to managing and helping the Jira planning.

### Daily stand-up
To manage the project as good as we can, we kept daily standups every day since the beginning of the project in week 1. In the standup we would discuss our progress, what we have done, issues and what you are going to do next. Also we discussed issues that came by. 

I couldnt really find great proof of those stand-ups except all the meetings in the teams environment. All teachers should have access to this environment to verify all our daily work.
