## Planning

### Introduction
At the start of the project we decided as a group how we would work on this project. In this first meeting we decided how we would plan meetings, do our daily standups and how we would communicate with our stakeholders. 


### My work
As a group everybody was responsible to keep track of the Jira board. I saw this task as really important because it's important that everybody has knowledge what you are doing, and what the current status is. 
On the following link(LINK HERE) you can see our Jira board, and my contributions to this.

I wrote a more specific introduction about our planning, and way of working in our [research plan](/Evidence/Research%20Project/Research%20plan%20(1).docx).
